```

## Organisations

What is the make up of the organisations that the respondents are working in?

```{r org, echo=FALSE}
summary(clean_responses[3:4])
summary(clean_responses[5:7])
```

And where are they located?

## Role

How happy were the respondents with their roadmap process and level of responsibilty in the role?
```{r role, echo=FALSE}
clean_responses %>%
  select(Job.title, roadmap.happiness, role.happiness , roadmap.DEEPScore, roadmap.mat_level) %>% 
  group_by(Job.title) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            roadmap.happiness = mean(roadmap.happiness),
            role.happiness = mean(role.happiness)) 

```

Where do people go to get their information?

```{r role2, echo=FALSE}
clean_responses %>%
  select(Job.title, info.events, info.blogs, info.books, info.communities, info.profbody, info.profcert, info.training, info.vendor, info.google) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character,as.factor) %>%
  group_by(Job.title) %>%
  summarise("Events and conferences" = sum(info.events)/n()*100,
            "Blogs" = sum(info.blogs)/n()*100,
            "Books" = sum(info.books)/n()*100,
            "Online Communities" = sum(info.communities)/n()*100,
            "Professional Bodies" = sum(info.profbody)/n()*100,
            "Professional Certification" = sum(info.profcert)/n()*100,
            "Professional Training" = sum(info.training)/n()*100,
            "Tool Vendor material" = sum(info.vendor)/n()*100,
            "Google" = sum(info.google)/n()*100)
```

## Roadmap

How mature were the roadmap processes by job title of respondent? Also did happiness with the roadmap process lead to a higher maturity score?
```{r roadmap, echo=FALSE}
clean_responses %>%
  select(Job.title, roadmap.DEEPScore, roadmap.mat_level) %>% 
  group_by(Job.title) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            roadmap.DEEPScore = mean(roadmap.DEEPScore),
            roadmap.mat_level = mean(roadmap.mat_level)) 


ggplot(clean_responses) +
  geom_point(aes(x = roadmap.happiness, y = roadmap.DEEPScore, colour = roadmap.mat_level, shape = org.industry))
